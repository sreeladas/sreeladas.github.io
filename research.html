        My research interests are in high-energy particle physics and astro-particle physics - which is to say I like the use of accelerators <i>and</i> 
        telescopes as instruments. <br /><br />
        I currently work with the <a href="https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/">VERITAS</a> experiment which is a ground based 
        Cherenkov telescope. Here I do data analysis and tests of stability - statistical and algorithmic (systematic), in addition to searches for 
        interesting objects/phenomena in our archival data. <br /><br />
        I recently ran a small test of stability across observation zenith angles, to check that our analysis packages reconstruct the same object as 
        having the same flux (within uncertainty), irrespective of where we view it from. This test was somewhat limited by our direction reconstruction 
        efficiency at larger values of zenith angle - the method used follows
        Most recently, I am working on optimizing a method for shower direction reconstruction using the location of the source in the camera plane and the 
        location center of gravity of the image. For this I am training boosted decision trees to generate weight tables based on the parameters we consider 
        relevant. The initial motivation for this was a stability test I ran on data across observation zenith angles, to see if the reconstructed source 
        flux was stable, that I hope/expect to be able to extend to larger zenith angles using this reconstruction method.<br /><br />
        I have previously worked on a study of the statistical fluctuations in upper limits set based on a single observation and the magnitude of differences 
        we should reasonably expect.<br />
